Remmeber to use myenv when using llamaindex

python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate

Is how I originally set it up
deactivate -> exits myenv
source myenv/bin/activate -> enters myenv

starter.py (was just learning how llamaindex works)
window.py integrates tk and recursive; I found that index > chat
windownotion.py is an attempt to make notion work with westcoastnft notion database
